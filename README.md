# haterzmapper

An `R` package for mapping diversity (ethnic, racial, linguistic or otherwise).

`haterzmapper` extends some of the functionality of the `sf` and `tidycensus` packages making it simple to subset simple feature data structures and gather census related data pertaining to specific geographies. It also provides some handy diversity functions (*ex*. *shannon index*).

#### Why is it called "haterzmapper"

This package is a product of my research, which involves understanding the geography of diversity and peoples' perceptions of other populations. This project is called `haterz` and, since this is a primarily geographic extension of that project, `haterzmapper` seemed most appropriate.
